    "# DISCUSSION\n",
    "The overarching principle to establish a secure connection is to have both the client and server implement asymmetric encryption and perform a form of a hand shake by sending their public keys to each other. The server will then generate a symmetric key and send it to the client. Once complete both the client and server have the symmetric key which will be used for all further messages. In short, the asymmetric keys are only used to send the symmetric key, and all traffic sent by the application thereafter is sent using the symmetric key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this system the students started with their lab 2 code. As soon as the server and client objects are instantiated and initialized, they both also generate their public and private keys. Furthermore, the server also generates the symmetric key and its “symmetric box” at this time. The symmetric key generation was done on the server side since in a real environment the server would most likely have a valid certificate given by a certificate authority, and is therefore more trustworthy than the client. Once the TCP connection between the two machines is established, the asymmetric public keys are exchanged. As soon as each has the public key of the other, they subsequently create their “asymmetric boxes” to facilitate the exchange of the symmetric key. Once the server has sent the symmetric key through the asymmetric box to the client, the client creates its symmetric box and all communications henceforth proceed using symmetric encryption. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the symmetric box, each sent message is passed through the encrypt function of the box first. For any sent data, the slices of said data are encrypted individually first through the encryption function, then transmitted. This is done in case there are packet drops - should the entire message be encrypted and then sliced up and sent, should a single packet be dropped during transmission, the final ciphertext would not be decryptable. Slicing it up the data first, then encrypting ensures that at least part of the total message sent can be decrypted and reconstructed. Although, this is more of concern in UDP than in TCP. Accordingly, the receiver decrypts each of the data slices it receives with its symmetric box, and subsequently reforms the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the packet has been fully sent a hash of the file is computed by the sender and sent to the receiver. Meanwhile, the receiver also calculates the hash of the file it sent - once it receives the sender’s hash, it compares the two to ensure that the encrypting, sending, and decrypting of the file was complete and correct. The hash comparisons make for a very quick and convenient way to verify the integrity of transmitted encrypted data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, all of the above was implemented by simplifying adding an “encryption layer” in the original TCP FTP interface. A few extra methods were created in order to facilitate key generation and exchanges, in addition to the main sending and receiving methods seeing a few modifications to implement encryption and decryption of data. In other words, essentially no modifications were made in the client and server scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions\n",
    "1. Why do we choose the FTServer to generate the symmetric key and not the FTClient? For example, what would happen if the key was generated by the FTClient and a malicious Client attempted to connect?  \n",
    "To begin, the FTServer is to generate the key since we can assume it has a valid certification in a real life setting. Thus the server is seen as a more trustworthy entity then the  Furthermore, in a scenario where the FTClient is responsible for generating the symmetric key, this essentially leaves the client entirely in control of the encryption strength used in the conversation. Consequently, they have the power to set how computationally complex it is. If the server does not set proper defenses against receiving keys such as these, this could lead to very computationally heavy encryptions for both the server and the client. This effectively forces the server to expend a large amount of resources on solely talking with the malicious client, ultimately denying all services to other clients who are also trying to use the server."
