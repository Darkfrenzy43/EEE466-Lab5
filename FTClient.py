    Notes:
    
        1. Just an interesting observation I've made when we're getting files from the server. I added code that 
        verifies if we actually did receive a particular file from the server and placed it into the client's Receive
        folder, because when I ended up calling "get, server_text_01.txt" and subsequently "get, server_text_02.txt",
        nothing would change in pycharm's Project Explorer window, but until I quit the program then the Project
        Explorer populates and I see that the client's Receive folder contains the requested files. Seems like pycharm
        doesn't automatically update the Project Explorer until the current program it is executing terminates.
        Accordingly, to ensure that we really did receive the files, I do an extra check on the client side if
        we actually have the files in the Receive directory, even if pycharm hasn't updated to reflect accordingly. 

        2. Below are the possible server responses:
            "QUIT ACK" --> server acknowledges the quit command that was sent. Prep client to quit as well.
            "PUT ACK" --> server acknowledges the put command it was sent. Prep client to send file.
            "GET ACK" --> server acknowledges the get command it was sent. Prep client to receive file.
            -------------------- CLIENT SIDE ERRORS (handled in separate function) ---------------------
            "TOO MANY ARGS" --> client sent too many args to the server.
            "UNRECOG COMM"  --> client sent an unrecognizable command to server.
            "NONEXIST FILE" --> client has requested from the server a non-existent file in the latter's database.
            "NO FILE" --> client had sent a put/get request, but without specifying a file name.
            "QUIT INVALID" --> client had sent the server arguments with the quit command. Server refused.
