""" 
    Notes:
    
        1. Ensuring we get proper input from the user is pretty simple. If the number of elements that we parse
        is more than 2 (meaning we get something more than "command,file_name"), then obviously that is bad input.
        Furthermore, once the command is parsed, first we check the command portion if it s valid command. Then 
        we check the file_name if it is a valid file path (using os.path.exists()). If any of these are violated,
        then we stop processing the given command and continue execution according to the lab instructions.
        
        2. We'll be allowing white spaces in between the command elements. This means that "command,file_name" is valid,
        in addition to "  command   ,   file_name ". 
        
        3. Side note: I'm getting a lot of "pycharm suggests you turn a class method that doesn't use <self> in the
        method body into static" suggestions. We could, however I'm choosing not to in order to not introduce
        another factor of static class methods into the code. It wouldn't exactly hurt having these methods in
        question still remain as class methods. 
        
        4. Just decided that we're adding a few more enumerated server states: PUT_COMM and GET_COMM. I decided
        that to make the program flow linear, we're not going to call the sending file and receiving file commands
        in the decode_and_execute() function (in fact, we're renaming that to simply decode). The function will
        simply return the server state the client is requesting. If the client wants to put a file on the server, 
        the function returns PUT_COMM. If the client wants to get a file, the function returns GET_COMM. Remember,
        at this point all the bad input errors are handled as well. Also, adding a NO_FILE state that is returned
        when the client sends a put or get request, but no "file name element" was put in the command as well. 
        
        5. Adding one more thing. It's going to be a design choice where if the client sends more than one element when
        the server receives a "quit" command, then it will also throw an invalid quit error. This gets handled just
        like the rest of the bad input errors. 
        
        6. Just so it wasn't clear in the code flow, the server sends an acknowledgement to the user whenever it 
        it receives a valid command, letting the user know that it processed it all good and well.
