    "\n",
    "This lab will build on your knowledge of general TCP/IP communications and add elements of security using cryptography, provided by the PyNaCl library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this lab is to improve the TCP based FTP Client and Server applications you created in Lab 2 by adding elements of security using cryptography. You may begin by either creating a new PyCharm project following the instructions from Lab 2 or by copying the project you created for Lab 2 and modifying it; be sure to start with a working lab 2 implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide the cryptography services used for this lab we'll be making use of the PyNaCl cryptography library. PyNaCl is a Python module which makes use of the libsodium crypography library. libsodium is meant to simplify the usage of common cryptography operations in order to prevent common mistakes made in distributed systems. You can learn more about PyNaCl at the [official documentation](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The remainder of this section walks through basic cryptographic operations using PyNaCl. Run the code blocks to follow along."

    "For Symmetric Encryption we'll be using the very simplified PyNaCl SecretBox class. This class will do all the heavy lifting for us by creating appropriate nonces and authentication codes (digests/hashes) to ensure that our messages aren't tampered with and that we know where they came from.\n",
    "\n",

    "The worst case from a security perspective is that an attacker doing a man-in-the-middle could insert duplicate data into our TCP connections, which would be processed as if it were a real message. We can overcome this by adding our own sequence numbers to our plaintext messages or adding additional checksums in our protocol, but we'll mitigate this risk by confirming downloads using hashes after they complete. \n",

    "## 5.2 - Requirements\n",
    "* The client and server will communicate via TCP socket using the SecureTCPFileTransfer class. It is recommended that you copy your interface from lab 2 and build on the encryption mechanism.\n",
    "* Both client and server generate private and public keys on initialization;\n",
    "* When the client connects to the server they will perform a symmetric key exchange using public key encryption. The server will generate the symmetric key and send it to the client;\n",
    "* All communications following the key exchange will be encrypted using the shared symmetric key;\n",
    "* If the server ever receives a ciphertext which does not decrypt to a valid plaintext, it will send an appropriate error message to the client and close the connection;\n",
    "* Due to the session oriented nature of the cryptographic communications, all communications will be conducted over a single socket which must not be closed and re-opened during the exchange of commands or the transferring of files;\n",
    "* Files must be transferred as a series of smaller messages containing no more than 1024 bytes of data. \n",
    "    * &#128073; The encrypted payload is longer than the unencrypted data due to nonce and hash size - this must be accounted for. Note that the encrypted payload size is constant for a constant plaintext size.\n",
    "* After a file transfer is complete the sending component will send a hash of the complete file which will be verified by the receiving side, if the hash does not match the receiving side will signal an error which the client will display to the user;\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will require adding or modifying code to the FTServer, FTClient, and SecureTCPFileTransfer. The recommended approach is to create a handshake method for the server and for the client first that performs the key exchange. Once this has been verified, move on to encrypting communications in the interface, and finally adding hash checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: It is not recommended to use the send/receive command methods in the interface to perform the key exchange as you'll need to add symmetric encryption to these methods. Instead, consider creating interface send and receive methods specifically for unencrypted traffic that are used to perform the key exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: As in previous labs, your FTClient and FTServer must be capable of executing even if the directory they are installed in is moved, ie do not hard code absolute paths to the Send and Recieve folders, use relative paths. Marks will be deducted if your code crashes because it was moved to a new location (ie the computer of the instructor marking it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3 - Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of distributed system development is to properly test your implementation. Be sure to run through a good set of test cases to both test proper functionality and for error cases. The files you transfer should be of different sizes and be able to transmit in either direction. Remember to test your program's ability to handle errors arising from using an incorrect symmetric key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain your testing in your submitted code, and include any test files as needed. Reminder: you don't *need* to include testing information in your submission but if your code fails, clearly documented testing can provide partial marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions\n",
    "1. Why do we choose the FTServer to generate the symmetric key and not the FTClient? For example, what would happen if the key was generated by the FTClient and a malicious Client attempted to connect?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective for this lab is to implement the following files using the requirements listed in part 5.2.\n",

    "2. FTClient.py\n",
    "3. FTServer.py\n",
