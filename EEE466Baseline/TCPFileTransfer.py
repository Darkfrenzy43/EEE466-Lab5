"""
    NOTES: 
        
        1. For now, we'll be making our own "protocol" of how we're sending messages more than 1028 bytes over. 
        Whenever we send a message, we slice up the bytes, let the receiving device know how many slices we're sending
        their way, and then we send the bytes accordingly. The receiving device will receive the first byte telling
        them how many slices to expect, and calls recv() the appropriate amount of times to receive it. 

        2. Decided to implement a send-recv ack msg in the send_and_slice() and recv_and_parse() relations
        since it seems the sender would send the contents of the databyte stream along with the initial
        slice number count, filling up the buffer with data more than the slice number, something
        that can't be converted back into an int. This was a solution to ensure that in the event the
        sending was happening faster than the receiving, that we clearly separate the transmission
        of the slice number count, and the data slices themselves. 
        
        3. For some reason when opening the file data in send_file(), when I used with open("file.txt", 'r') and
        then tried to read the file with open_file.read(), I would get some sort of UnicodeDecodeError where
        characters map to <undefined>. Did some research and if I specify the encoding during the file opening to
        utf-8 (with open("file.txt", 'utf-8')) the issue is resolved. Probably will need to do the same thing
        for the writing file portion. 
        
        4. Added a few more "verifications" when we are sending and receiving data across the network:
            1. Checking to see if a connection actually exists before we send/receive data. If not, we notify the 
                user function.
            2. The sending device checks if the receiving device is expecting the data format the former is sending. 
                ie. If the sender is sending a file, but it detects the receiving device is expecting a command,
                then errors are thrown on both sides, BUT THE CONNECTION IS NOT CLOSED. It can still function just fine. 
                
           Just refactored this functionality into a class method so the API methods are a lot more cleaner.
